# RenPy_Example

Charles Riley, María E. Ramos-Morales
CS616 Spring 2015
Interactive Project

Age range: 
6th through 8th grade

Concepts: 
Basic programming constructs will be taught, such as variables, variable names, variable types, comments, conditional statements(if/else), loops (while), as well as debugging errors. 

Media/materials:
Computers with Windows/OSX installed for using Ren’Py 

Learning outcomes: 
Basic programming constructs will be taught, such as variables, variable names, variable types, comments, conditional statements (if/else), loops (while), as well as debugging errors. The medium through which these concepts will be taught is RenPy, a visual novel engine based on the programming language Python. We expect the students to acquire a general idea of programming from the lesson, to learn some basic programming, to finish the lesson wanting to continue programming and working with Ren’Py so as to make more stories on their own, and lastly we expect them to look for more resources, guides and tutorials online on their own accord. 

Method for assessing if outcomes were met:
We can assess that the learning outcomes were met by having the students create their own small Ren’Py story in class and by viewing their code to see if they used all the concepts that were taught.

Instructions:
See the instructions.pdf file for the instructions for the teacher. See the handout.pdf file for instructions for the student.

Products:
Handout for students (handout.pdf), handout for teacher (instructions.pdf).

Resources:
Sample Ren’Py story for demonstration of programming concepts being taught (code, images, and supporting files in project folder called “cs616”).
